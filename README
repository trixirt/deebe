DEEBE : Pronounced 'Debbie'

Deebe is a drop in replacement for gdbserver.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

To Build 
Deebe is configured with autoconf.  A pre configure setup 
requires running the bootstrap.sh script in the toplevel directory.  Once 
this is done, the normal autoconf project commands of configure, make, 
make install are done.  The normal build steps are

$ > mkdir path-to-your-build-dir
$ > cd path-to-src-dir
$ > ./bootstrap.sh
$ > cd path-to-your-build-dir
$ > path-to-src-dir/configure
$ > make
$ > su
$ > make install

The default install location is /usr/local/bin/

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

To Run :

Because deebe is drop-in replacment for gdbserver, the way gdbserver is
run is the way deebe is run.  The command line arguements gdbserver has,
deebe also has. etc.  Good documentation on gdbserver exists already.  A
good place to start is with this wiki.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gdbserver

The usual way deebe is used is by either starting a process or attaching
to a running process on the remote machine, then using gdb on the local
machine to communicate with deebe.

On the remote machine either

Starting a process

deebe IP_ADDRESS:PORT program arg1 arg2 ..

ex/

deebe 10.123.45.67:2345 /usr/bin/true

Or to attach to running process

deebe IP_ADDRESS:PORT --attach PID

ex/

deebe 10.123.45.67:2345 --attach 54321

On the local machine

Load the program's executable,

(gdb) file path-to-program/program

Connect to deebe

(gdb) target remote IP_ADDRESS:PORT

ex/

(gdb) target remote 10.123.45.65:2345

Once gdb acknowledges the connection, debug as normal.

Deebe support a few additional command line options. They are
  --forward IP_ADDRESS:PORT
  --watchdog <minutes>

--forward IP_ADDRESS:PORT

This feature allows debugging of compilated network configurations.
This option forwards network traffic to another deebe that is does the
debugging.  Normally there is only a single deebe

GDB -> DEEBE

With the --forward, there can be one or more of intermediate network
forwarding deebe's.  

GDB -> DEEBE A -> DEEBE B -> DEEBE C

--watchdog <minutes>

This feature instructs deebe to exit after the user defined number of
minutes without activity.

Hacking Deebe

For people who want to understand what deebe does.

Enabling the debug output.
The debug output is written to the file /tmp/deebe.log.  The file pointer is
opened at the being of main.c 

#ifndef DEEBE_RELEASE                                                           
        FILE *try_log = fopen(LOG_FILENAME, "wt"); 
	...
#endif

If this is a release, no output.  To disable the DEEBE_RELEASE #ifdef, 
comment out this define in global.h

#define DEEBE_RELEASE

Immediately below is this macro that wraps fprintf.

#ifdef DEEBE_RELEASE
#define DBG_PRINT(fmt, args...)
#else
#define DBG_PRINT(fmt, args...) util_log(fmt, ##args)
#endif

The macro is used for most debugging output.  It's use is also controlled
on a per feature basis through debug output flags defined at the top of 
the file/feature of interest.  For example, in network.c the raw input
and output buffer can be captured to logfile.

...

static bool network_verbose_print_read_buffer = true;
static bool network_verbose_print_write_buffer = true;

...

And their use later in the file

... 

if (network_verbose_print_read_buffer) {
	DBG_PRINT("----->\n");
	util_print_buffer(fp_log, network_in_buffer_current,
	                  network_in_buffer_total, &network_in_buffer[0]);
	if (fp_log)
		fflush(fp_log);
}

...

if (network_verbose_print_write_buffer) {
	DBG_PRINT("<-----\n");
	util_print_buffer(fp_log, network_out_buffer_current,
	                  network_out_buffer_total, &network_out_buffer[0]);
	if (fp_log)
		fflush(fp_log);
}

Submitting patches

YES! Please submit patches

Patches should be generated using the git command

$ > git format-patch <commit id>

Each patch should contain a single logical change and a commit log
explaining the change.

Coding Style

The coding style, with a few exceptions is the linux kernel's coding style.

http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/CodingStyle

Your work can be checked with the linux kernel's style checking script
checkpatch.pl.  

The exceptions are:
Line length > 80.
Initializing static or global variable to 0.
Use of typedef.
